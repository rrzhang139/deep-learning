Before BERT and GPT, most sequence modeling was based on smaller datasets, and models were designed for specific sequence modeling tasks.\n","\n","OpenAI's initial release of GPT was the first attempt at showing how powerful the transformer model could be by scaling it to train on an internet-scale dataset. It introduced the idea of pre-training on these datasets, and then fine-tuning on more task specific datasets using transfer learning to accomplish the tasks more effectively.\n","\n","BERT noticed that GPT missed out on a few key archictectural details that hurt its performance - notably the use of the left-to-right next token prediction objective.\n","\n","By improving on the approaches of GPT, BERT finally built a new pre-trained language model that beat state-of-the-art on a wide variety of language tasks despite not training on them directly.\n","\n","BERT was arguably the beginning of the wave of attention focused on large language models, and BERT and GPT were also arguably the first successful large language models.\n","\n","### Intuition\n","\n","BERT made two main improvements over GPT that allows it to be so effective.\n","\n","First, it replaced the left-to-right next token prediction objective. The authors of BERT suspected that this objective didn't allow GPT to properly learn about context from words in both directions, which significantly inhibited it's understanding and language modeling capabilities.\n","\n","BERT replaced this with the **masked language model** (MLM) objective where it learns to predict a random masked word in a sequence based on all the surrounding words. In this way, it learns to understand the relevance of context in both directions for each word, which enables much more robust understanding of sequences.\n","\n","Additionally, BERT introduced the **next sentence prediction** (NSP) task - its able to classify whether sequential sentence relate to each other or not. This forced BERT not just to understand the relationships between words, but also to understand sequences of sentences and how they relate to each other.\n","\n","This may have also boosted the results of BERT, although the task was later found to be unnecessary in the RoBERTa paper, and was removed.\n","\n","### RoBERTa\n","\n","Due to the clear impact of BERT, many replication studies came out soon after to confirm the results of BERT.\n","\n","Notably, one replication study - RoBERTa - trained a model that significanatly outperformed BERT on all tasks.\n","\n","This study showed a few of the flaws with BERT - it was significantly undertrained and the NSP task was unnecessary (and removed). It also introduces optimizations to the MLM objective, and put much more effort into tuning BERTs hyperparameters effectively.\n","\n","The significance of RoBERTA was not just in creating an optimized version of BERT, but also in emphasizing the importance of paying attention to the details of hyperparameters and other variables and the leverage this can have when doing expensive training runs on large language models.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lM_P51FFr-2x"},"source":["# My Notes\n","\n","## 📜 [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805)\n","\n","> We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.\n","\n","> BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from\n","> unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\n","> left and right context in all layers.\n","\n","> As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, […] without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.\n","\n","BERT is built specifically for fine-tuning. It makes it easy to train a single base model and then use it to create a number of task specific models.\n","\n","> BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks.\n","\n","> There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: _feature-based_ and _fine-tuning._\n","\n","> We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches.\n","\n","> The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-right architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer.\n","\n","> Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying fine-tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\n","\n","The main problem of the original transformer design is that the left-to-right architecture during training means that words learn to soak up context from words on their left, but not on their right, whereas in understanding sentences, soaking up context from all directions is critical.\n","\n","> BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective.\n","\n","> The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on it’s context.\n","\n","Using this MLM objective, words can learn to absorb context from all other words around them, making the Transformer bidirectional.\n","\n","> We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations.\n","\n","> We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered task specific architectures.\n","\n","### **Related Work**\n","\n","**1.

The model is trained with some classification problems - and it’s initial token for every predicted sequence is the `[CLS]` token, meant to classify if the two sentences it was fed follow each other or not.\n","\n","Adding this task into the model forces the model to learn whether two sentences are actually related or not, rather than just assuming that the text it’s fed is all correctly related.\n","\n","**2.
